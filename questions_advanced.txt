QUESTION:Find the derivative of f(x) = sin(x^2) at x=π/2. Round to 2 decimal places.
ANSWER:-3.01
TOLERANCE:0.05
HINT:Chain rule: f'(x) = cos(x^2) * 2x. At x=π/2, this is cos((π/2)^2) * π

QUESTION:What is the quotient rule for derivatives?
A:(f/g)' = (f'g - fg')/g^2
B:(f/g)' = (f'g + fg')/g^2
C:(f/g)' = f'/g'
D:(f/g)' = (f' - g')/g
ANSWER:A
HINT:"Low d-high minus high d-low, all over low squared" - that's the quotient rule!

QUESTION:Find f'(x) if f(x) = e^(2x) at x=0. Round to 2 decimal places.
ANSWER:2
TOLERANCE:0.01
HINT:The derivative of e^(kx) is k*e^(kx). When x=0, e^0 = 1, so the answer is just k.

QUESTION:What is implicit differentiation used for?
A:Finding derivatives when y cannot be easily solved for
B:Finding derivatives of exponential functions
C:Finding derivatives of trigonometric functions
D:Finding antiderivatives
ANSWER:A
HINT:Implicit differentiation treats y as a function of x without solving for y explicitly.

QUESTION:Find dy/dx using implicit differentiation: x^2 + y^2 = 25, at point (3,4). Round to 2 decimal places.
ANSWER:-0.75
TOLERANCE:0.01
HINT:Differentiate both sides: 2x + 2y(dy/dx) = 0. Solve for dy/dx = -x/y. At (3,4): -3/4 = ?

QUESTION:Using the quotient rule, what is the derivative of f(x) = x/(x+1)?
A:1/(x+1)^2
B:1/(x+1)
C:-1/(x+1)^2
D:x/(x+1)^2
ANSWER:A
HINT:Quotient rule: [(1)(x+1) - (x)(1)] / (x+1)^2 = 1/(x+1)^2

QUESTION:What is the second derivative of f(x) = x^4?
A:4x^3
B:12x^2
C:24x
D:12x
ANSWER:B
HINT:First derivative is 4x^3. Take derivative again: 12x^2

QUESTION:Find dy/dx if y = cos(3x) at x=0. Round to 2 decimal places.
ANSWER:0
TOLERANCE:0.01
HINT:Chain rule: dy/dx = -sin(3x) * 3. At x=0, sin(0) = 0, so -3*0 = ?

QUESTION:What is the derivative of f(x) = tan(x)?
A:sec^2(x)
B:sec(x)tan(x)
C:cos^2(x)
D:-sec^2(x)
ANSWER:A
HINT:The derivative of tangent is secant squared!

QUESTION:Find f'(2) if f(x) = (x^2 + 1)/(x - 1). Round to 2 decimal places.
ANSWER:3
TOLERANCE:0.01
HINT:Quotient rule: f'(x) = [(2x)(x-1) - (x^2+1)(1)]/(x-1)^2. At x=2: [4-5]/1 = ?. Wait, recalculate: [4(1)-5]/1 = 3

QUESTION:What is the derivative of f(x) = ln(x^2)?
A:2/x
B:1/x^2
C:2x
D:1/(2x)
ANSWER:A
HINT:Chain rule: derivative of ln(u) is (1/u)*u'. Here u=x^2, so (1/x^2)*2x = 2/x

QUESTION:Using implicit differentiation, find dy/dx for x^3 + y^3 = 6xy:
A:-y^2/x^2
B:(y^2 - x^2)/(y^2 - x^2)
C:(2y - x^2)/(y^2 - 2x)
D:(x^2 - 2y)/(2x - y^2)
ANSWER:C
HINT:Differentiate: 3x^2 + 3y^2(dy/dx) = 6y + 6x(dy/dx). Solve for dy/dx.

QUESTION:Find the derivative of f(x) = sin(x)cos(x) at x=π/4. Round to 2 decimal places.
ANSWER:0
TOLERANCE:0.01
HINT:Product rule: f'(x) = cos(x)cos(x) + sin(x)(-sin(x)) = cos^2(x) - sin^2(x). At x=π/4, cos and sin are equal, so difference is 0.
