QUESTION:What is the derivative of a constant (like f(x) = 5)?
A:5
B:0
C:1
D:x
ANSWER:B
HINT:Constants don't change, so their rate of change is zero!

QUESTION:Find the derivative of f(x) = 3x
ANSWER:3
TOLERANCE:0.01
HINT:The derivative of x is 1, and the constant 3 stays. So 3*1 = ?

QUESTION:What is the derivative of f(x) = x?
A:0
B:1
C:x
D:2
ANSWER:B
HINT:This is the simplest power rule case where n=1. Bring down 1, subtract 1 from exponent: 1*x^0 = 1.

QUESTION:If f(x) = 2x^3, what is f'(x)?
A:2x^2
B:6x^2
C:6x
D:2x^3
ANSWER:B
HINT:Use the power rule: d/dx(x^n) = n*x^(n-1). Multiply coefficient by exponent (2*3=6), reduce exponent by 1.
