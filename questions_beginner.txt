B:The area under a curve
C:The maximum value of a function
D:The integral of a function
ANSWER:A
HINT:Think about how fast something is changing - like speed is the rate of change of distance.

QUESTION:What is the derivative of a constant (like f(x) = 5)?
A:5
B:0
C:1
D:x
ANSWER:B
HINT:Constants don't change, so their rate of change is zero!

QUESTION:What is the derivative of f(x) = x^2
A:2
B:0
C:x
D:2x
ANSWER:D
HINT:Use the power rule: d/dx(x^n) = n*x^(n-1).

QUESTION:What is the power rule for derivatives?
A:d/dx(x^n) = n*x^(n-1)
B:d/dx(x^n) = x^n
C:d/dx(x^n) = n*x^n
D:d/dx(x^n) = x^(n-1)
ANSWER:A
HINT:Remember: bring down the exponent, then subtract 1 from the exponent.

QUESTION:Find the derivative of f(x) = 3x
ANSWER:3
TOLERANCE:0.01
HINT:The derivative of x is 1, and the constant 3 stays. So 3*1 = ?
