QUESTION:Find value of the derivative f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x + 7 when x = 1
ANSWER:2
TOLERANCE:0.01
HINT:Use the power rule on each term separately. The derivative of a sum is the sum of derivatives. What's 3x^2 + 4x - 5 when x=1?

QUESTION:What is the product rule for derivatives?
A:(fg)' = f'g + fg'
B:(fg)' = f'g'
C:(fg)' = f'g - fg'
D:(fg)' = (f'+g')/2
ANSWER:A
HINT:Think "first times derivative of second PLUS second times derivative of first"

QUESTION:Find the derivative of f(x) = (x^2)(x+1) at x=2. Round to 2 decimal places.
ANSWER:16
TOLERANCE:0.01
HINT:Use product rule: f'g + fg'. If f=x^2 and g=x+1, then f'=2x and g'=1

QUESTION:What is the chain rule used for?
A:Finding derivatives of composite functions
B:Finding derivatives of products
C:Finding derivatives of quotients
D:Finding derivatives of constants
ANSWER:A
HINT:The chain rule is for functions within functions, like f(g(x))

QUESTION:Find dy/dx if y = (2x + 1)^2. Evaluate at x=1. Round to 2 decimal places.
ANSWER:12
TOLERANCE:0.01
HINT:Chain rule: dy/dx = 2(2x+1) * 2. When x=1, this equals 2(3)*2 = ?

QUESTION:Find the derivative of f(x) = 2x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1 at x = 2. Round to 2 decimal places.
ANSWER:16
TOLERANCE:0.01
HINT:f'(x) = 6x^2 - 6x + 4. Substitute x = 2: 6(4) - 6(2) + 4 = ?

TYPE:MC
QUESTION:What is the derivative of f(x) = e^x?
A:e^x
B:x*e^(x-1)
C:ln(x)
D:1/x
ANSWER:A
HINT:The exponential function e^x is special - it's its own derivative!

QUESTION:Find f'(x) if f(x) = x^2 * sin(x) at x = 0. Round to 2 decimal places.
ANSWER:0
TOLERANCE:0.01
HINT:Product rule: f'(x) = 2x*sin(x) + x^2*cos(x). At x=0, both terms become 0.

QUESTION:Using the chain rule, what is the derivative of f(x) = (3x + 2)^3?
A:3(3x + 2)^2
B:9(3x + 2)^2
C:(3x + 2)^3
D:3(3x + 2)
ANSWER:B
HINT:Chain rule: outer derivative * inner derivative. That's 3(3x+2)^2 * 3 = 9(3x+2)^2

QUESTION:Find the derivative of f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 1 at x = 3. Round to 2 decimal places.
ANSWER:0
TOLERANCE:0.01
HINT:f'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9. At x=3: 3(9) - 12(3) + 9 = 27 - 36 + 9 = ?

QUESTION:What is the derivative of f(x) = ln(x)?
A:1/x
B:x
C:e^x
D:1/x^2
ANSWER:A
HINT:The natural log has a simple derivative - just one over x.

TYPE:NUM
QUESTION:Find the derivative of f(x) = (x + 5)(x - 2) at x = 1. Round to 2 decimal places.
ANSWER:4
TOLERANCE:0.01
HINT:Product rule OR expand first. Either way: f'(x) = 2x + 3. At x=1: 2(1) + 3 = ?

TYPE:MC
QUESTION:If f(x) = x^4 - 4x^3 + 2, what is f'(x)?
A:4x^3 - 12x^2
B:x^3 - x^2
C:4x^3 - 4x^2
D:4x^4 - 12x^3
ANSWER:A
HINT:Apply power rule to each term: 4x^3 for first term, -12x^2 for second, 0 for constant.
