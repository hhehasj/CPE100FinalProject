QUESTION:Find value of the derivative f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x + 7 when x = 1
ANSWER:2
TOLERANCE:0.01
HINT:Use the power rule on each term separately. The derivative of a sum is the sum of derivatives. What's 3x^2 + 4x - 5 when x=1?

QUESTION:What is the product rule for derivatives?
A:(fg)' = f'g + fg'
B:(fg)' = f'g'
C:(fg)' = f'g - fg'
D:(fg)' = (f'+g')/2
ANSWER:A
HINT:Think "first times derivative of second PLUS second times derivative of first"

QUESTION:Find the derivative of f(x) = (x^2)(x+1) at x=2. Round to 2 decimal places.
ANSWER:16
TOLERANCE:0.01
HINT:Use product rule: f'g + fg'. If f=x^2 and g=x+1, then f'=2x and g'=1

QUESTION:Find dy/dx if y = (2x + 1)^2. Evaluate at x=1. Round to 2 decimal places.
ANSWER:12
TOLERANCE:0.01
HINT:Chain rule: dy/dx = 2(2x+1) * 2. When x=1, this equals 2(3)*2 = ?
