SECTION:Derivatives of Trigonometric Functions
CONTENT:Trigonometric functions have specific derivative formulas you need to memorize: d/dx(sin x) = cos x, d/dx(cos x) = -sin x, d/dx(tan x) = sec^2 x. These are fundamental building blocks for more complex problems. Combined with the chain rule, you can handle any trig derivative!
EXAMPLE:Find the derivative of f(x) = sin(x^2)
STEP1:Identify this as a composite function: sin(u) where u = x^2
STEP2:Derivative of outer function: cos(x^2)
STEP3:Derivative of inner function: 2x
STEP4:Apply chain rule: f'(x) = cos(x^2) * 2x = 2x*cos(x^2)

SECTION:The Quotient Rule
CONTENT:For dividing functions, use the quotient rule: (f/g)' = (f'g - fg')/g^2. A helpful mnemonic is "Low d-high minus high d-low, all over low squared." The denominator is always the square of the bottom function.
EXAMPLE:Find the derivative of f(x) = x^2/(x+1)
STEP1:Identify f = x^2 (high) and g = x+1 (low)
STEP2:Find f' = 2x and g' = 1
STEP3:Apply quotient rule: [(x+1)(2x) - x^2(1)]/(x+1)^2
STEP4:Simplify: (2x^2 + 2x - x^2)/(x+1)^2 = (x^2 + 2x)/(x+1)^2

SECTION:Exponential and Logarithmic Derivatives
CONTENT:The exponential function has a remarkable property: d/dx(e^x) = e^x. For other bases: d/dx(a^x) = a^x * ln(a). The natural logarithm follows: d/dx(ln x) = 1/x. Remember to use the chain rule when these functions have more complex arguments!
EXAMPLE:Find the derivative of f(x) = e^(3x)
STEP1:Identify composite function: e^u where u = 3x
STEP2:Derivative of e^u with respect to u: e^u
STEP3:Derivative of inner function 3x: 3
STEP4:Apply chain rule: f'(x) = e^(3x) * 3 = 3e^(3x)

SECTION:Implicit Differentiation
CONTENT:Sometimes equations define y implicitly rather than explicitly (like x^2 + y^2 = 25). To find dy/dx, differentiate both sides with respect to x, treating y as a function of x. Remember to use the chain rule when differentiating terms with y, which gives you dy/dx terms.
EXAMPLE:Find dy/dx if x^2 + y^2 = 25
STEP1:Differentiate both sides with respect to x
STEP2:d/dx(x^2) = 2x, d/dx(y^2) = 2y(dy/dx), d/dx(25) = 0
STEP3:Equation becomes: 2x + 2y(dy/dx) = 0
STEP4:Solve for dy/dx: dy/dx = -2x/(2y) = -x/y
