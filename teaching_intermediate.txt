SECTION:The Sum and Difference Rules
CONTENT:The derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives. Similarly, the derivative of a difference is the difference of the derivatives. Mathematically: d/dx(f + g) = f' + g' and d/dx(f - g) = f' - g'. This makes finding derivatives of polynomials very straightforward!
EXAMPLE:Find the derivative of f(x) = x^3 - 4x^2 + 2x - 7
STEP1:Take the derivative of each term separately
STEP2:d/dx(x^3) = 3x^2
STEP3:d/dx(-4x^2) = -8x, d/dx(2x) = 2, d/dx(-7) = 0
STEP4:Combine: f'(x) = 3x^2 - 8x + 2

SECTION:The Product Rule
CONTENT:When multiplying two functions, we can't just multiply their derivatives. Instead, we use the product rule: (fg)' = f'g + fg'. In words: "first times derivative of second, plus second times derivative of first." This rule is essential for products of functions.
EXAMPLE:Find the derivative of f(x) = x^2 * sin(x)
STEP1:Identify f = x^2 and g = sin(x)
STEP2:Find f' = 2x and g' = cos(x)
STEP3:Apply product rule: f'g + fg'
STEP4:Result: 2x*sin(x) + x^2*cos(x)

SECTION:The Chain Rule - Basics
CONTENT:The chain rule is used for composite functions (functions within functions). If y = f(g(x)), then dy/dx = f'(g(x)) * g'(x). Think of it as the "derivative of the outside times the derivative of the inside." This is one of the most powerful rules in calculus!
EXAMPLE:Find the derivative of f(x) = (3x + 1)^4
STEP1:Identify outer function: u^4, inner function: u = 3x + 1
STEP2:Derivative of outer (with respect to u): 4u^3
STEP3:Derivative of inner: 3
STEP4:Chain rule: 4(3x+1)^3 * 3 = 12(3x+1)^3

SECTION:Evaluating Derivatives at a Point
CONTENT:After finding a derivative formula, we can evaluate it at specific x-values to find the instantaneous rate of change at that point. This tells us the slope of the tangent line at that point on the curve. Simply substitute the x-value into the derivative formula.
EXAMPLE:If f'(x) = 2x + 3, find f'(2)
STEP1:Take the derivative formula: f'(x) = 2x + 3
STEP2:Substitute x = 2: f'(2) = 2(2) + 3
STEP3:Calculate: f'(2) = 4 + 3
STEP4:Result: f'(2) = 7
